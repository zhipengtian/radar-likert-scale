This project is built upon the <a href="https://github.com/alangrafu/radar-chart-d3">d3 radar chart project</a>.

The radar likert scale is first-of-its-kind. It is not solely a display tool, but a interactive input widget. User can make selections on it and get real-time feedback.

Demo: <a href="http://54.88.99.219/interface4_polygon/"> a online bank setting page </a>
